Source code for the back end of my project.
I used a different repository during the implementation of my back end it is linked here: https://github.com/CSLI10/golf-backend-app


The back end is hosted using versel here: https://golf-backend-app.vercel.app/



To compile open this folder in Visual Studio Code and run 'npm install'. Then run 'npm start'.
